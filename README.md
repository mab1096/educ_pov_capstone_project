## Education Poverty Economic Growth, Economics Research Session Capstone Project

This project focused on how education is related to poverty and economic growth. There were two parts of this project I did, the first where I worked with a group to research the problem and do the economic theory and literature review areas, and the second where I worked independently to conduct the full data science process. We each recognized our strengths and worked together cohesively to complete the project and present at the UNH Paul College Undergraduate Research Conference, as one of the only groups to conduct a full data science project in our class. In this project I utilized R, Excel, & Tableau to gather data, create datasets, clean the data, conduct exploratory data analysis, create models and tests, then visualize and present the results in a clear understandable way to the judges at the PCBE Undergraduate Research Conference. I wrote the Data, Methods, & Results section of the paper, Created Visualizations, Merged the data into one dataset and did the full data science process independently. The types of models created were: SLR’s, MLR’s, Log-Transforms & Log. Regressions, and tested the data. E-mail me → mab1096unh@gmail.com for the full research paper.
